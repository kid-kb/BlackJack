# The Casino Game(Black Jack)

So I tried to make another game in `python` :)

#### Concepts Used: 
+ OOPS Concepts
+ Exception Handling
+ Functions
+ Loops 
+ Conditional Statements 

#### About the Game
+ The main rule is to get as close to 21 as you can without going over!
+ Dealer hits until she reaches 17. Aces count as 1 or 11.

You can learn more about the game here [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

#### Instructions for game:
+ First the player places his bet.
+ Then player chooses to hit or stand.
+ This goes on until:
  + Player Busts
  + Dealer Busts
  + Tie

##### So go on play and have fun.
